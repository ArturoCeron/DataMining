# What is the Origin of the graphs?
One of the main characteristics of these statistics is that they can make a lot of our variety of graphical representations of data that can help us understand the behavior of certain variables with which we work, graphical or graphical representations have great importance in the development that it had about understanding the data so that with the passage of time more and more types of graphs were developed, each one to better represent proposed problems, but where do the graphs really come from? The truth is that there is no certain science a point in time which can be taken as a reference since since Archimedean times, and the birth of the integral calculus, it can be taken as a reference to raise the origin of the area under a parabola, that today can be used to obtain a population density, but this does not represent the origin of the graphs in statistics, if we see it in such a way, then take as its origin not too far back the natural philosopher and theologian Joseph Priestley (1733 -1804) which in his work A New Chart of History would publish the first known and recorded chronograms.

This philosopher as support material, or a better way of understanding history, developed a series of timelines that allow him to understand, through bars, relationships between certain dates.

About twenty years later, taking Priestley as inspiration, a Scottish engineer and economist, William Playfair (1759-1823), developed a novel type of graph which began the furor for graphing and analyzing different events. Specifically in 1786 he published his Commercial and Political Atlas, considered the first important work with graphic statistics, in this work he shows a great variety of graphics where he represents imports and exports from different countries. This idea, added to the absence of information from his own country, which translated into the inability to graph using his method, gave birth to a new graph, the bar graph, which was the first graph that did not have time and time as a variable. the one that opened the possibilities of graphing any phenomenon.

This was the birth of the graphs for data analysis, some time later personalities such as John Snow, Charles Joseph and Charles Luis de Fourcroy arrived, who highlight the importance of these graphs by making contributions in fields such as medicine or the military.

# What is the grammar of graphs?
The grammar of the graphs refers to a set of rules that helps us build understandable statistical graphs, very similar to the grammatical rules of our language, such as the subject and the predicate that form a sentence, the graphs deal with the same thing, there is a subject that can be the event or the object and the predicate that symbolizes the behavior that is represented in the graph.
In natural language it can be said that the minimum wage of a country increases according to the years, in this precise case we say that the minimum wage of a country is our subject and increases according to the years is our predicate or our fact this translated into a graph we could see it this way.

This methodology is not limited to this, as mentioned by Joaquin Sevilla in his book Grammar of graphics. Clues to improve data representations (2005) graphs and language are not different, both have sentences, paragraphs, subjects, predicates, simple, compound and subordinate sentences, which translated into graphs would be graphics, infographics, magnitude, visual impression, graph with a single data series, graph with more than one data series and graph related to others, another point taken by Joaquin Sevilla is the appropriate use of different types of graphs, since each of the existing methods serve us to Representing a specific group of phenomena and misusing this leads us to possibly generate difficulty for the reader to understand what is happening, all this gives us a different perspective about what a graph is, which is useful for analysis and that finally this is understandable for the person who visualizes it, which in the end is the main objective of the graphics.
